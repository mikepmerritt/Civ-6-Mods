# CaptureZones

## About

Initially developed as a project for SER300, the CaptureZones mod seeks to add a new win condition to the game to encourage more aggression, diplomacy, and interaction in multiplayer games. The functionality was inspired by victory cards from *Europa Universalis 4*, in which the game would mark states that were owned by a potential rival as victory conditions to encourage more interesting diplomatic agreements and wars. To accomplish this, the CaptureZones mod adds:

- A new strategic resource with high yields called Victory Points, which is placed in border cities at the start of the Classical, Renaissance, and Modern Eras
- Two new projects using Victory Points which can be completed at the Government Plaza for increased unit Combat Strength and Diplomatic Favor generation
- Three new tile improvements for gaining Victory Points as well as production, science, and culture
- A new victory condition for completing both new projects
- A great reason to culture bomb, loyalty flip, or declare war your friends

## Installation (for gameplay)
1. Begin by downloading `CaptureZones.zip` from the most recent release
2. Navigate to your local Civilization VI game files, and select the `Mods` folder
    - For the Steam installation of Civilization VI, the default location is in `Documents` in a folder called `Sid Meier's Civilization VI`
    - As an example of where you need to go, my mods need to go into `C:\Users\scarf\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods`
3. Extract the contents of `CaptureZones.zip` into the `Mods` folder
    - If you do this correctly, the folder should now contain a folder named `CaptureZones`
4. Launch the game, and verify that the mod is listed in game by going to `Additional Content -> Mods`
